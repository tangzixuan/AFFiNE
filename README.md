<em>Docs, canvas and tables are hyper-merged with AFFiNE - just like the word affine (əˈfʌɪn | a-fine).</em>

## Features

- **Hyper merged** — Write, draw and plan all at once. Assemble any blocks you love on any canvas you like to enjoy seamless transitions between workflows with AFFiNE.
- **Privacy focussed** — AFFiNE is built with your privacy in mind and is one of our key concerns. We want you to keep control of your data, allowing you to store it as you like, where you like while still being able to freely edit and view your data on-demand.
- **Offline-first** — With your privacy in mind we also decided to go offline-first. This means that AFFiNE can be used offline, whether you want to view or edit, with support for conflict-free merging when you are back online.
- **Clean, intuitive design** — With AFFiNE you can concentrate on editing with a clean and modern interface. Which is responsive, so it looks great on tablets too, and mobile support is coming in the future.
- **Modern Block Editor with Markdown support** — A modern block editor can help you not only for docs, but slides and tables as well. When you write in AFFiNE you can use Markdown syntax which helps create an easier editing experience, that can be experienced with just a keyboard. And this allows you to export your data cleanly into Markdown.
- **Collaboration** — Whether you want to collaborate with yourself across multiple devices, or work together with others, support for collaboration and multiplayer is out-of-the-box, which makes it easy for teams to get started with AFFiNE.
- **Choice of multiple languages** — Thanks to community contributions AFFiNE offers support for multiple languages. If you don't find your language or would like to suggest some changes we welcome your contributions.
